Many good ideas

- [ ] don't allow pressing button to download,
if no cookie set, this fails in any case.

- [ ]  Make the interface vertical

- [ ] only show download location once it is downloaded. 
Provide a widget that shows download location (maybe pop up) 
this widget contains a link to the download 
location. User only has to press on it. Very quick transition to desktop.
